# Exhaustive stability analysis in a consensus system with time delay and irregular topologies

[Rudy Cepeda-Gomez & Nejat Olgac (2011) Exhaustive stability analysis in a consensus system with time delay and irregular topologies, International Journal of Control, 84:4, 746-757, DOI: 10.1080/00207179.2011.576272](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207179.2011.576272)

This code can count the system's stable zone for a given P and D with the fastest reaching consensus tau, and it can also plot stable zone influenced  by D and tau, which will be referred when designing the PD parameters. All of this run with the method introduced by the article mentioned above.

By the way, I do really bad on typing MATLAB code. To be honest, I cannot even ensure you running this code successfully. With just a few examples tested by me, they all  passed correctly, and I hope you can too.

Also, do not forget to copy the folder "improved_CTCR" to the same directory.
